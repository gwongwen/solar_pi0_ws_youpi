# Description of Solar Pi Platter board
The Solar Pi Platter is a versatile expansion board for the Raspberry Pi Zero W computers that provides power from a single-cell rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery, additional peripherals including analog inputs, PWM outputs, USB ports and optional hardwired ethernet. A real-time clock allows for scheduled power cycling. Dual charging sources support both low-impedance devices like common USB chargers and high-impedance devices like solar panels. The Solar Pi Platter allows the Pi Zero to be used in a wide variety of applications ranging from solar-powered remote data acquisition systems to battery-backed file servers.

# Description of basic tests
In basic tests folder, several tests written on python are purposed in order to test separently the  BMP388 sensor and the LoRa protocol. These tests come directly from the manufacturers.

## Test BMP388 sensor
According to python3 is installed, run this script **test_bmp3xx.py** to check the pressure/temperature sensor. With coherent values, this means that the sensor is operating correctly.

## Test I2C bus in parallel mode
According to python3 is installed, run the script **test_parallel_i2c.py** to check if I2C bus can work on parallel mode (screen display of Adafruit LoRa Radio Bonnet and BMP388 sensor). To verify that they are working properly, we just have to watch if on the screen display there is the same temperature as on the command line. If it is the case, and the temperature is not a nonesense, this would mean that your BMP388 sensor is measuring while the display is done, so it all works well. To verify if the values of your BMP388 sensor are real you can try to touch the sensor and the temperature should increase.

## Test LoRa chipset radio RFM95W and the TTN application
According to python3 is installed, run these scripts to chipset radio (RFM95) and the TTN comunication :
    
    - test_dot_env.py to check the TTN sensor configuration and verify the TTN sensor information
    - test_reconfigure_from_mqtt.py to check the standard for IoT messaging
    - test_rfm9x.py to check the Adafruit radio+oled Bonnet
    - test_send_lora.py to check if a data from the BMP388 can be transmitted on the TTN network application

To test the LoRa device (both sending and receiving), we need to execute the **test_rfm9x.py**. Then, after that, we have to look at the screen and see the output. If the radio module is not detected, it will display RFM69: ERROR. However, if everything works correctly and you press the three buttons (one by one) you should see "ada fruit radio". If you are able to see these messages the hardware should be ready to start working as well as the libraries and dependencies..

To verify that you receive the packets on your TTN application, run **test_send_lora.py**. After that, you have to paste the file **payload_format.js** into the TTN application decoder function so you can read the packets content in real time already decripted.
